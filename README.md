This repository establishes a Python SDK for accessing the Auckland Transport API.

Additionally it establishes a module for generating maps of active vehicles in Auckland.

## Usage

To use the SDK you will first need to obtain an API key via https://dev-portal.at.govt.nz/

or by including a config.py file that has it defined
